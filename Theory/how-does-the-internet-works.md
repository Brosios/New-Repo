> The Internet is not a Fuzzy Cloud:

The Internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground, this simply what it is.
Internet is usfel, Two computers Connecetde to this wire can communicate, a Computers connected directly to the internet are called **"Servers"**, while the computers you and I use are **"clients"** because they are not connected directly to the Internet, but through an Internet Service Provider, all the Web Pages you see are files on the Servers herd drive and every Server has a unique Internet Protocol Address or IP Address just like a Postal Address, IP Addresses help Computers to find each other but since 72.14.205.100 dosen't really roll off the tounge we also give them names like Google.com or Facebook.com or Becode.org...

> This is how it works:

So let's pretend you're at home using your laptop and you're using ADSL and let's assume that you want to visit aol.com which coincidentally both Server and ISP **(Internet Serveice Provider)**, you hop onto your laptop then go through your ISP onto the Internet and look at aol.com, now your Computer is conncets with aol.com and you can look at Its web pages.
In another example you want to send your aunt Ruth an Email, aunt Ruth has aol dail-up from home and you've got a Gmail account, you log into your account and you compose an Email to aunt Ruth's Email Address, once you click on send Gmail sent the Email to aol.com and the second day aunt Ruth dials into her account on aol.com servers and retrives the Email.

> Packets:

Whenever an Email, Picture or webpage travels across the Internet computers break the information into a smaller pieces called packtes, when this information reaches its destination the packets will reassembled in their original order to make a picture, Email or web page or even tweet.
now imagine that you're siting at work next to your Boss and both of you are surfing online, your Boss is doing some research and you're updating your Facebook profile, both of you are sending packets back and fourth over the internet, but what keeps your packets away from accidentally ending up on your Boss's screen?
the answer of this is **IP Addreses** and **Routers**, everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet has an IP Address, everthing, that include your computer servers, cell phones and all of equipment in between, anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect there's a piece of equipment called a **Router**, Ruters direct your packets around the Internet helping ech one of them to get one step closer to its destination, every time you visit a website upwards of ten to fifteen routers may help your packtes find their way to and from your Computer, imagine each packet as a piece of candy wrapped in several layers, the first layer is your Computer's IP Address, Your computer send the packet to the first router which adds its own IP Address and each time the packet reaches a new router another layer is added until it reaches the server then when the server sends back information it creats packets with an identical wrapping as the packet makes its way over the internet back to your Computer each router unwraps a layer to discover where to send the packet next until it reaches your Computer and mot your Boss's.
