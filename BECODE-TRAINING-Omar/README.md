A young professional guy who's looking for an opportunity to enrich my experience in
life.
After living several
experiences because of my immigration,
I was able to stone my character and become
stronger and more flexible.

where I can put my energy for the
project development, as well as
my professional skills.

## My Fears
Befor starting the course i was so afraid that im not going to be accepted and the good news that this did'nt happened, i needed to be in this course becuase i want really to learn and i want to be good Dev in the future this all what im looking for.
one other thing makes me a bit worrid which is that for the first time in life I am learning in a language that is not my mother tongue and I do not master it perfectly, and i think for now this is my bigest fears for now.
